# LaTeX Tuturial of the Fachschaft WIAI

This tutorial for the typesetting system [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) comprises the most general topics for writing a beautiful, high-quality thesis.

* Basic formatting
* Footnotes
* Images
* Formulas
* Tables
* Enumerations
* Literature Management
* Best practices for large documents 

The tutorial is designed as a **one-day crash course** for **non-programmers** to learn LaTeX. The didactic concept is an alteration between **lectures** about the beforementioned topics and **hands-on exercises** where the learners are asked to recreate documents with LaTeX.
